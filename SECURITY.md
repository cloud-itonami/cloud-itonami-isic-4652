# Security Policy

This project handles telecom-equipment supply-chain-sourcing status,
counterparty-credit, and sanctions-screening workflows. Treat
vulnerabilities as potentially high impact even when the demo data is
synthetic.

## Do Not Disclose Publicly

Report privately before opening public issues for:

- credential exposure
- real counterparty, credit, manufacturer/sourcing, buyer-category, or
  trade data exposure
- authorization bypass
- Telecom Supply-Chain Governor bypass
- audit-ledger tampering
- over-disclosure in reports or exports
- tenant isolation failures

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available for the repository.
If that is unavailable, contact the repository maintainers through the
cloud-itonami organization before publishing details.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected and actual behavior
- impact on counterparty data, covered-manufacturer/buyer-category
  integrity, or audit logging
- suggested fix, if known

## Production Guidance

- Store secrets outside Git.
- Keep real counterparty, credit, manufacturer/sourcing, buyer-category
  and sanctions-screening data outside this repository.
- Run policy tests before deployment.
- Export and review audit logs regularly.
- Use least privilege for operators and service accounts.
